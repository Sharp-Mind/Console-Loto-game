Here are two cards with numbers. 
A number in the range from 1 to 90 (no repetitions) will be displayed. 
If there is a number in the player's card, you need to click "yes", 
if there is no dropped out number, you need to answer "no". 
If you answer incorrectly, you lose. 
The card with Computer numbers is filled in automatically.
